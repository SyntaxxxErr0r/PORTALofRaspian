PORTALofRaspian
===============

Raspian port of thegrugq's PORTALofPi for Arch (https://github.com/grugq/PORTALofPi)

Debian support via rednerd (https://rednerd.com/2013/12/07/portal-for-debian/)

Overview
========

This does the same thing as the aforementioned projects: Provides a transparent Tor proxy and SOCKS support for accessing hidden services on a Raspberry Pi running Raspian. Internets come in via wlan0 and maxTor'd Internets go out via eth0. Simple enough.

I made this because I figured some others were having hardware compatiblity issues with their wifi adapters with Arch on Pi too ::sadface::. Raspian worked flawlessly with my adapter though, so I modified a few simple things to get the goods.
